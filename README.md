﻿# Ramsey-NumbersThis site contains the solution graphs which prove new lower bounds for Ramsey Numbers described in the following paper:> Computatonally new IP-based bounds for small Ramsey Numbres using circulant colorings  by Fabio Furini, Ivana Ljubic and Pablo San Segundo (under review 2021).Each file provides a graph in 0-1 matrix format, the first line is the order of the graph. A 0 in row i and column j coposition (i, j)  represents the red edges and 1 rpre
