﻿# Ramsey-Numbers

This site contains the solution graphs which prove new lower bounds for Ramsey Numbers described in the following paper:

> Computatonally new IP-based bounds for small Ramsey Numbres using circulant colorings  
by Fabio Furini, Ivana Ljubic and Pablo San Segundo (under review 2021).

Each file provides a graph in 0-1 matrix format, the first line is the order of the graph. A 0 in row i and column j refers to a red edge with endpoints in vertices i and j. A 1 in row i and column j refers to a blue edge with endpoints in vertices i and j.
